BukkitGames
===========

The old version of the BukkitGames plugin. It is no longer being updated or maintained. 
For the new version of the BukkitGames plugin head over to [the new project page](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bukkitgames.279/).

When you are using anything from the code available here, please make sure you follow the license terms.
If you update the plugin or improve it, it would be very nice if you would share your work as well.
